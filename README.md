# Algorithmic-Trading

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of algorithmic trading strategies, with a focus on pair trading and PCA (Principal Component Analysis). It contains a set of exercises and a comprehensive project that leverages these techniques to develop robust trading models.

## Pair Trading Exercise
The pair trading directory contains a tutorial and implementation of the pair trading strategy. This strategy identifies pairs of stocks that exhibit historical price convergence and takes advantage of price efficiency when they diverge. 

## Performing PCA on a dataset of multiple asset returns
Analyzing the loadings of principal components to understand the underlying factors
Evaluating the variance explained by each component
Determining the number of components necessary to explain a significant portion of the variance (75% and 80% thresholds)

## Project
Following the assignment instructions provided, the project will:

- Load a specified dataset and perform PCA to extract the main components.
- Calculate and display the loadings for the first six components.
- Determine the minimum number of components needed to explain a substantial amount of variance.
- Analyze the cumulative returns of the principal components.
- Conduct regression analysis for each factor against the principal components and assess the best-explained factors by each component.
- Study traditional assets by loading another dataset and computing correlations with the principal components.
- Visualize the results through scatter plots and correlate traditional assets with the principal components.
